# Fandango-Project
A case study of the discrepency occurring in the movie ratings of an aggregator website called Fandango. (Data was collected in 2015 and as per the data available today, it seems that Fandango has dropped their discrepency practices.)


PS update - Updated the Pandas, and other libraries to comply with modern changes, such as version changes, resolving depreciation issues.
